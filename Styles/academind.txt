As a student of this course you also get free access to our "Academind Community" on Discord: https://discord.gg/gxvEWGU

There, you can find like-minded people, discuss issues, help each other, share progress, successes and ideas and simply have a good time!

I believe that you learn the most if you don't learn alone but find learning partners and other people with similar interests. Our community is a great place for this - it's the perfect complimentary resource for this course.

Joining it is of course free and 100% optional.
